    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Calgary, with a research focus on international trade, energy and environmental economics. I also serve as a Research Fellow at the Smart Prosperity Institute, where I lead a $30,000 research grant-funded project examining the productivity effects of energy efficiency in Canada. My broader interests include applied econometrics, trade policy, and high-resolution air pollution modeling using InMAP. My work has been published in <em>The World Economy</em> and presented at major international conferences. I am in 2025-2026 Job Market.</p>

  <strong>The Role of Energy Efficiency in Productivity: Evidence from Canada</strong>
  <a href="The_Role_of_Energy_Efficiency_in_Productivity__Evidence_from_Canada__manuscript___Copy_11_August_2025_ (15).pdf" target="_blank">Job Market Paper (PDF)</a>
</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper quantifies how the misallocation of energy, capital, and labor across
provinces and sectors reduces productivity in Canada. Using annual provincial input–output
data (2014–2020) and a standard Hsieh–Klenow–style framework, I decompose the loss
into interprovincial (within-sector) and intersectoral (within-province) components and
measure each input’s contribution. Unlike most studies focusing on firm-level variation within
manufacturing, I examine the full economy at the province–sector level. The results show that
misallocation drags aggregate productivity 5–8% below its efficient potential, depending on
the assumed substitutability of goods between provinces. Within-sector misallocation drives
most of the loss, reaching 4.3%, while between-sector misallocation contributes up to 4%,
consistently less than the within-sector component, indicating interprovincial misallocation is
the primary source. While energy accounts for only 8% of input costs, it makes up as much
as 1.5% of the gap—comparable to capital’s 1.8% peak and substantially exceeding that of
labor’s 0.8%—highlighting energy’s key role in productivity.</p>

    <h3>Peer-Reviewed Publications</h3>
    <p><strong>Revisiting Trade and Income in the New Era of Globalization: Distance, Big Boats, and Natural Barriers to Trade</strong><br>
    <em>The World Economy</em>, Volume 48, Issue 12, Pages 886–921.<br>
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/twec.13667" target="_blank">Read the paper</a></p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the relationship between international trade and income, exploiting a dynamic distance measure generated by the growth of container ships and Panama Canal capacity. Employing a version of the gravity model, this paper constructs an instrument for trade that accounts for bilateral trade flow differences driven by the Panama Canal and big ships. I exploit the created instrument, given its purely geography-based nature, to estimate the impact of trade on income between 2002 and 2022. This paper finds a trade elasticity of income at 0.4, indicating that a one-dollar increase in trade translates into a 40-cent higher income on average. Compared to earlier studies, this indicates a more pronounced impact of trade on income in the recent era of globalisation.</p>

    <p><strong>Uneven Gains: The Environmental Justice Impact of the RGGI on Air Pollution and Health</strong><br>
    (Joint with Sookti Chaudhary and Linh Pham)</p>
     <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines the distributional impacts of carbon cap-and-trade programs, using the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) program in the U.S. northeastern states as a quasi-natural experiment. First, using power-plant level data from 2000 to 2019, we evaluate the indirect effects of the CO2 cap set by the RGGI on local air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Our empirical approach employs a difference-in-differences (DiD) strategy with heterogeneous treatment effects to preserve the differential impacts of the program across individual power plants. Next, based on the estimated plant-level pollution reductions from the DiD model, we investigate the differences in emissions across various locations, to identify the environmental justice (EJ) effects of the cap-and-trade program. Specifically, we feed the DiD results into a high-resolution intervention air pollution model (InMAP) to analyze the variations in pollution reduction amounts among different demographic groups across fine-grained areas (1 km x 1 km), aggregated to the census tract level. We find significant variation in how the program affects emissions across power plants, leading to uneven health benefits, with avoided deaths varying by regions.
